# uh-data-structures
University projects for creating custom data structures

This is an old project from the University (uh = University of Havana) that I found, and my objective is update it with better codding practices. Maybe I could create a .Nuget package with the result.

# data structures implemented
- List
- Heap
- Avl
- Dictionary
